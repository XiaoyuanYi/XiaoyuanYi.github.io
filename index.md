## Bio

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Xiaoyuan Yi is a PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. Xiaoyuan received his BS degree in 2016 from Tsinghua University. His research focuses on deep learning applied to natural language processing, automatic text generation and grammar error correction. He has published over 10 papers in leading NLP/AI conferences including AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, EMNLP, CoNLL, etc.
